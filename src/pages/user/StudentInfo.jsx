                            The Student Season Pass allows school students to travel between their 
                            home and school conveniently at a discounted monthly fare. To apply, 
                            simply fill out the form with your personal and school details, upload 
                            your student photo certified by principal and payment slip, and submit 
                            your application online. After submission, the CTB staff will verify 
                            your information and notify you by email or SMS once your pass is approved. 
                            You can then download your digital QR e-pass directly from your account 
                            for use on any CTB bus.
